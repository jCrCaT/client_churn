# Client churn analisis and predict
This is a script developed to analyze data to predict and get insights from a Telco Company. This analisis was made to continue with the Datascientist nanodegrees from Udacity.
This project tries to answer the next questions:

<p><b>Question 1:</b>  What kind of clients are leaving the company</p>
<p><b>Question 2:</b>  Which products are the most popular?</p>
<p><b>Question 3:</b>  Wich products are causing more churn? </p>
<p><b>Question 4:</b>  Which kind of contract are our clients getting on?</p>
<p><b>Question 5:</b>  Can we predict the clients leaving? </p>

And the methodology used on this project is crisp-dm, implementing the next steps:

<p>Business Understanding</p>
<p>Data Understanding</p>
<p>Prepare Data</p>
<p>Data Modeling</p>
<p>Evaluation</p>
